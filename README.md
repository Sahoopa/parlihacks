[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://beta.mybinder.org/v2/gh/psychemedia/parlikhacks/master)

This is a proof-of-concept to deploy a Binder that exposes the RStudio UI as well as a Jupyter Notebook (via [binder-examples/dockerfile-rstudio/](https://github.com/binder-examples/dockerfile-rstudio/)). To start the RStudio session from the Jupyter notebook homepage, click on "new", and select `RStudio Session`.
